# Hawkeye-Placement-DS-Project
Data science project using data from a cricket match, as part of Hawkeye's recruitment process for the placement year. Author: Ollie Trevarthen

I would like to thank you, Hawkeye, for the opportunity to complete this project as part of your recruitment process - regardless of the outcome. I am an applied mathematician by training and relatively new to data science so I hope you will also consider the other skills that I can bring to the team. I am a passionate sports fan, numerically proficient and academically successful - looking to bring my enthusiasm and skills to your team due to our shared interests!
